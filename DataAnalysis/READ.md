<b>1. Introduction</b><br>
In this assignment, you will examine a number of factors that relate to wages for a group of males from the Atlantic region of the United States. 
In particular, you will try to understand the association between an employee’s age, an employee’s educational attainment, 
as well as the calendar year and an employee’s wage. (G. JAMES ET AL., 2013)<br>
<b>2. The Data</b><br>
