<b>Introduction</b><br>
Germany suffered from a severe drought in 2018. According to the German Drought Monitor1 operated by the “Helmholtz-Centre for Environmental Research” (UFZ) the soil moisture in the upmost 180 cm of soil has still not recovered. Particularly in Eastern Germany as well as Bavaria the drought index yet reveals exceptional droughts until today.
Your task is to analyse the drought in 2018 in comparison to the years 2016 and 2017 utilising different data sources and tools. The underlying hypotheses2 are:
1. The drought affects vegetation and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) shows the effects on vegetation.
2. The drought is related to the cumulative precipitation CP (i.e. the precipitation sum) over the last year. There is a correlation between CP and NDVI.
3. The drought is related to the average temperature AT over the last year. There is a correlation between AT and NDVI as well as AT and CP.
